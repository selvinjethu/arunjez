And it\u2019s quite easy to see which category Mountain Stone Estate finds itself in. This Aspen homes jewel is the epitome of luxury and customization, and it\u2019s the perfect example of how we proudly cater to a homeowner\u2019s every whim. As a rule, the team at Aspen Homes, during every phase of design\u00a0and construction, strives for nothing less than perfection \u2013 and when we create such a monumental piece of art like Mountain Stone, this commitment can be seen in every corner of the house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This estate is not only in the upper stratosphere of luxury; it was also built with the highest level of comfort in mind. After all it\u2019s a home, not a museum (although it could serve as that, too). The numbers are impressive: 12,845 sq. ft., 6 bedroom suites, 3 powder bathrooms, and an additional in-law quarters complete with bedroom, living room, dining room, and bathroom suite.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When building something of this nature, here at Aspen we rely on what has played a major role in making our company successful \u2013 we are proactive and completely responsive throughout the entire process. Our team is always there to answer any question, address any issue, and make any change requested. We\u2019re about developing relationships, regardless of the size and cost of a home. Every house we build becomes part of the Aspen family, and Mountain Stone\u00a0Estate is no exception.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-3566\" src=\"http:\/\/www.aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/mtn-stn-02-1000x563.jpg\" alt=\"mtn-stn-02-1000x563\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" \/><\/span><span class=\"s1\">This place is indeed grandiose, as the layout includes a butler\u2019s pantry, a theater, an arcade room, a bar, fitness center, and a large wine cellar. You name it, we built it here. And the atmosphere of this home was created in a design approach that we maintain an expertise in. Specifically, the style is Old World Rustic, with hand-hewn hickory floors, real stone veneer for the interior rock, and cultured stone for the exterior. We also created a soothing flow across the entire interior, with a custom floating staircase, wood burning fireplace with sandstone details, and custom crown molding throughout. Of course, we were meticulous in the creation of a home\u2019s most important room \u2013 the kitchen. Here, the floors are natural chiseled travertine, the counters are rusticated edge granite, the cabinets are old world distressed alder, and the appliances are top-tier commercial grade.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As you can see, in staying true to the vision of the homeowner, we pulled out all the stops. Mountain Stone\u00a0Estate is not just a unique home, it\u2019s a distinctly Aspen home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding: 20px 0;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3574 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/www.aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/tagline2-210x59.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"213\" height=\"60\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"gallery_link\" style=\"margin-top: 40px;\">\n<h3>Mountain Stone Gallery<\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019s beautiful, and then there\u2019s breathtaking.
