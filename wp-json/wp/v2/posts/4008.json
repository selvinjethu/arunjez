It\u2019s a region with incredible geography, and we enjoy the best of all seasons \u2013 especially wintertime. It\u2019s indeed a wonderland here in North Idaho, whether you\u2019re all in for skiing, snowboarding, or snowmobiling, or if you simply like to appreciate the scenery from the coziness of home with your feet up, and your coffee filled up. Yet along with the wintry weather you enjoy, it\u2019s also weather that you should prepare for, particularly when it comes to taking care of your house. One must take winterizing their home seriously, as it will help avoid issues caused by the cold, snow and ice, and ensure comfortable living throughout the season. Here are some essential winterization steps to take before winter sets in:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">01. Service your heating system<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nobody wants their heating system conking out in the middle of a Northwest winter. Make sure to get your furnace or heat pump inspected so it\u2019s clean and in good condition. An important aspect of a professional inspection is that it can also measure carbon monoxide leakage. Additionally, check your furnace filters on a monthly basis, and regularly vacuum out the floor grates.<\/span><span class=\"s2\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>02. Get your fireplace cleaned and chimney swept<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Before you enjoy the glow of a crackling fire, make sure your fireplace, chimney and vents are clean and in good repair. This will prevent chimney fires and prevent carbon monoxide from seeping into the house.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_6051\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6051\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-6051 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/chimney-12-steps-winterize-1024x512.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/chimney-12-steps-winterize-1024x512.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/chimney-12-steps-winterize-300x150.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/chimney-12-steps-winterize-768x384.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/chimney-12-steps-winterize.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-6051\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Clean Your Fireplace and Chimney Swept<\/p><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>03. Reverse Your Ceiling Fans<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When your heat is on, putting your ceiling fan in reverse mode \u2013 clockwise direction \u2013 will create an updraft and push heated air down into the room from the ceiling. This is very effective in areas with high ceilings, and can possibly enable you to turn down the thermostat a degree or two. Doing so can save you on energy costs throughout the winter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>04. Make Your Roof Right<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Assess your roof \u2013 in a safe manner &#8211; for damaged, loose or missing shingles that may leak during a winter storm from melting snow. It\u2019s also crucial to check and repair breaks in the flashing seals around vent stacks and chimneys, as well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_6054\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6054\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-6054 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/roof-winterize-1024x512.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/roof-winterize-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/roof-winterize-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/roof-winterize-768x384.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/roof-winterize.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-6054\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Make Your Roof Right<\/p><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>05. Consider More Caulking<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is an ideal time to check the gaps between siding and window or door frames. If they are bigger than the width of a nickel, you need to reapply exterior caulk. We recommend using silicone caulk as it won\u2019t shrink or be weathered by the cold, snow, or ice.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>06. Clean the Gutters<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Gutters can turn out to be the major culprit of causing damage. If they are full of debris, water can back up against the house and damage roofing, siding and wood trim, or cause leaks and ice dams. It\u2019s essential to identify missing or damaged gutters and repair or replace them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>07. Disconnect Hoses and Turn Off Exterior Faucets<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an easy one. Disconnect all garden hoses and drain the water that remains in faucets, as remaining water in pipes can freeze, which will cause pipes to burst as the ice expands. If your house doesn\u2019t have frost-proof faucets, turn off the shut-off valve inside your home.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>08. Blow Out Your Lawn Irrigation System<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Blow out sprinkler-system pipes will help avoid freezing and leaks.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_6056\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6056\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-6056 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/irrigation-winterize-1024x512.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/irrigation-winterize-1024x512.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/irrigation-winterize-300x150.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/irrigation-winterize-768x384.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.aspenhomes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/irrigation-winterize.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-6056\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Blow Out Lawn Irrigation System<\/p><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>09. Check Your Sump Pump<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Testing to see if stuff works \u2013 especially important systems \u2013 is always a good idea. To test your sump pump, slowly pour several gallons of water into the sump pit to see whether the pump turns on.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>10. Get Down and Dirty<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Most likely you don\u2019t often visit your crawl space, but the perfect time to do so is in January. This is where moisture and drainage problems can cause the most damage &#8211; and as the summer is often so dry in the Northwest, standing water typically doesn\u2019t show up until January, when the soil has been fully re-saturated. In the case that you notice standing water, determine if it\u2019s coming from pipes inside the house or from water flowing in through cracks in the foundation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>11. Prune Your Trees<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You want to keep your trees away from the house. Contact with trees is bad for roofs and siding, as friction and trapped moisture wreak havoc on building materials. Do the majority of your pruning in the winter, when trees are dormant.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>12. Close Garage Doors<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Of course, your garage is typically the coldest space of your house \u2013 odds are you don\u2019t keep it heated. When the garage shares ceilings and walls with adjacent rooms, if you forget to close those garage doors, pipes located in the garage ceiling may freeze. Make sure the kids stay on top of this, too!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Putting in some extra work now can potentially save you some challenging and costly work a few months down the road. By taking these precautionary winterizing steps you\u2019ll enjoy greater peace of mind, and be able to focus on enjoying all the fun that comes with a Northwest winter.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>12 Helpful Tips to Winterize Your Home &nbsp; Living in the majestic Northwest truly makes us feel fortunate.
