There’s beautiful, and then there’s breathtaking. And it’s quite easy to see which category Mountain Stone Estate finds itself in. This Aspen homes jewel is the epitome of luxury and customization, and it’s the perfect example of how we proudly cater to a homeowner’s every whim. As a rule, the team at Aspen Homes, during every phase of design and construction, strives for nothing less than perfection – and when we create such a monumental piece of art like Mountain Stone, this commitment can be seen in every corner of the house.</span></p>
<p>This estate is not only in the upper stratosphere of luxury; it was also built with the highest level of comfort in mind. After all it’s a home, not a museum (although it could serve as that, too). The numbers are impressive: 12,845 sq. ft., 6 bedroom suites, 3 powder bathrooms, and an additional in-law quarters complete with bedroom, living room, dining room, and bathroom suite.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When building something of this nature, here at Aspen we rely on what has played a major role in making our company successful – we are proactive and completely responsive throughout the entire process. Our team is always there to answer any question, address any issue, and make any change requested. We’re about developing relationships, regardless of the size and cost of a home. Every house we build becomes part of the Aspen family, and Mountain Stone Estate is no exception.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3566" src="https://ga4prozbj7-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/mtn-stn-02-1000x563.jpg" alt="mtn-stn-02-1000x563" width="1000" height="563" /></span><span class="s1">This place is indeed grandiose, as the layout includes a butler’s pantry, a theater, an arcade room, a bar, fitness center, and a large wine cellar. You name it, we built it here. And the atmosphere of this home was created in a design approach that we maintain an expertise in. Specifically, the style is Old World Rustic, with hand-hewn hickory floors, real stone veneer for the interior rock, and cultured stone for the exterior. We also created a soothing flow across the entire interior, with a custom floating staircase, wood burning fireplace with sandstone details, and custom crown molding throughout. Of course, we were meticulous in the creation of a home’s most important room – the kitchen. Here, the floors are natural chiseled travertine, the counters are rusticated edge granite, the cabinets are old world distressed alder, and the appliances are top-tier commercial grade.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As you can see, in staying true to the vision of the homeowner, we pulled out all the stops. Mountain Stone Estate is not just a unique home, it’s a distinctly Aspen home.</span></p>
